            <p class="about-us-subheader">My web development story began in August 2025 by asking Gemini to build me a simple website. Within a month, I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JamStack, CMS, LDE, SSG, Functions with API Key security, integrating to a PWA, and much much more. Gemini was the catalyst that enabled me with the tools/knowledge to build super-fast and secure websites, but my business background and sense is what made my web development engaging and unique; I drive business to your site and convert visitors into clients/enthusiasts of your vision.</p>

                    <p>Founder & Lead Developer</p>
                    <p class="team-bio">Growing up in Hawaii, Dan graduated from the University of Oregonâ€™s Lundquist College of Business to pursue an early career in entrepreneurship, and learning from local businesses in Eugene and Portland. A return to Hawaii, introduced Dan to beekeeping. A new chapter began when Dan and his wife welcomed their son and moved to Thailand. Dan began teaching English and farming. With the advent of AI, Dan decided to take a leap into Web Dev and never looked back. My background and perspective are unique, diverse, and will result in equally powerful websites.</p>
