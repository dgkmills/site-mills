            <h1>Say Goodbye to Hosting Fees: Why Modern Websites Cost Less & Do More</h1>
            <p class="post-meta">Published on October 10, 2025 by Dan Mills</p>
            
            <p>When you think about getting a new website, you probably budget for the initial design and build. But what about the hidden costs? For years, business owners have been stuck paying monthly fees for hosting, maintenance, and security updates, often for slow websites built on platforms like WordPress.</p>
            <p><strong>What if you could eliminate those costs entirely?</strong></p>
            <p>I build websites using a modern, serverless approach. This isn't just a technical detailâ€”it's a fundamental shift that results in a faster, more secure, and dramatically more affordable website for your business or project.</p>

            <h2>The Old Way: Traditional Hosting</h2>
            <p>Traditional websites rely on a central server that works like a rented warehouse. Every time a visitor wants to see a page, the server has to run code, grab data from a database, assemble the page, and then send it. This process can be slow, creates security risks, and requires constant maintenance. You pay a fixed monthly rent for this "warehouse," whether you have one visitor or one thousand.</p>
            <img src="/assets/images/oldwayserver.png" alt="Diagram of an old, clunky server setup representing traditional hosting." class="blog-post-image">

            <h2>The New Way: Serverless & The Jamstack</h2>
             <p>A serverless website works more like a global, on-demand delivery service. Instead of building the page for every visitor, we pre-build your entire website into a set of ultra-fast, optimized files. This architectural approach is often called the Jamstack: **J**avaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup.</p>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe 
                    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_chQsstDlLQ" 
                    title="YouTube video player: What is JAMStack" 
                    frameborder="0" 
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
                    allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>

            <p>These pre-built files are then distributed across a global Content Delivery Network (CDN). When a visitor comes to your site, the page is delivered instantly from the location closest to them. There's no complex server to manage, no database to query, and no code to run on a server for the basic page load.</p>
            <img src="/assets/images/serverlessway.png" alt="Diagram of a modern, global serverless network showing instant delivery." class="blog-post-image">
            
            <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
            <p>This modern approach delivers four key benefits that directly impact your bottom line and peace of mind.</p>

            <h3>1. Blazing-Fast Speed</h3>
            <p>Because your pages are pre-built and served from a global network, they load almost instantly. A faster website means a better user experience, which leads to higher engagement, more conversions, and better rankings on Google.</p>

            <h3>2. Fort Knox-Level Security</h3>
            <p>One of the biggest headaches with platforms like WordPress is the constant need for security updates. Serverless sites have a dramatically smaller attack surface because there's no traditional server or complex backend to hack.</p>

            <h3>3. Radically Lower (or Zero) Costs</h3>
            <p>This is the game-changer. The services used to host serverless websites, like Netlify and Firebase, have incredibly generous free tiers. For the vast majority of small and medium-sized businesses, this means your monthly hosting bill is $0. If your site's traffic explodes, the serverless model scales with you on a pay-as-you-go basis, so you never pay for capacity you don't use.</p>

            <h3>4. Zero Maintenance Headaches</h3>
            <p>Forget about "update" notifications and plugin compatibility issues. A serverless site is stable and reliable. Once it's built and deployed, it just works. This frees you up to focus on what you do best: running your business.</p>
