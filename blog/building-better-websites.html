                <h1>Building Better Websites, Together</h1>
                <p class="article-meta">Published on: September 20, 2025 by Daniel Mills</p>
                
                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Are you a business owner looking for a new website? You’ve probably heard of terms like WordPress, Squarespace, or Shopify. And while those platforms can be great, they also have their downsides—like slow load times, security vulnerabilities, and a long list of monthly fees.</p>
                    <p>My approach is different. I don’t use templates or pre-made themes. Instead, I use a modern, collaborative process to build websites that are fast, secure, and uniquely yours. Let me explain how we can do it together.</p>
                    
                    <h2>A Case Study: Turning a Filing Cabinet into a Recruitment Engine</h2>
                    <p>Every professional needs a website that works as hard as they do. Recently, I had the opportunity to transform a university-hosted academic profile from a passive "digital filing cabinet" into an active tool for student recruitment.</p>
                    <p>The original site was static, impersonal, and slow. It listed publications in a plain, unformatted block and lacked any dynamic features to engage prospective students.</p>

                    <div class="image-comparison-container">
                        <div class="image-comparison-item">
                            <h3 class="image-comparison-header">Before</h3>
                            <img src="../assets/images/kmuttpagescreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the old, text-heavy university profile page." class="article-image">
                            <p class="image-caption">The original university profile was text-heavy and functioned like a digital filing cabinet.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="image-comparison-item">
                            <h3 class="image-comparison-header">After</h3>
                            <img src="../assets/images/newsitetopscreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the new, modern and clean professional website." class="article-image">
                             <p class="image-caption">The new site features a clean design, a professional headshot, and interactive elements.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Using our modern workflow, we created a new website that was more than just an aesthetic upgrade—it was a strategic overhaul. The new site loads instantly, looks professional, and now features an interactive tool called the "Student Research Idea Generator."</p>
                    
                    <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px;">Try The Tool Yourself</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">This tool allows a prospective student to select an area of expertise and receive a personalized research idea.</p>
